Momento is a digital scrap booking application that uses the structuring and UI methods that make instagram popular to help you format your pictures with captions.
Think of it sort of like an unsocial social media platform, who's goal is to help you remember important momments.


Basic application Blueprint:

            Welcome Screen
                   |                 <-------
                   |                        |
  Login  ------------------- Signup         |
    |                          |            |
    --------------|-------------            | 
       -->        |                         |
      |           |                         |
create memory--Home Screen-------options    |
                  |                |        |
                  |                |        |
            Inspect Memory      Log out------


The user starts out on the Welcome screen where they're asked if they'd like sign up or login
from there they're directed to the respective page but maintain the ability to switch between the two.
Upon creation of an account the users infomation is sent off to the data base and stored as authentication
this is important because the project works of off the firebase authenticaion.

after a user has signed up or logged in they're directed to the home screen where they'll initally have two options.
use the drawer navigation to switch over to options and sign out of their account or create a memory.

Upon log out the user will be redirected to the inital screen they selected thanks to firebase.

whena  user creates a memory they select an image and write a caption, which are both then sent back to the database/storage

when a new memory has been created it will apear on the home screen in a simialr fashion to how instagram posts are displayed
upon clicking on one the user can view the caption and has the option to update or delete the post theyre viewing,
which will then update context and database/storage object.

that pretty much wraps up the blueprinting and example of how the app works
